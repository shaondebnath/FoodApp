# Food App

This is a sample food delivery app developed on React-Native

This app contains feature:

- Stack Navigator

- Restaurent list and filter by Categories

- Search Restaurants

- Add Restaurants to Favorite list

- Google Sign in / Sign out.

- Save data locally using async-storage

- Browse menu of a restaurent using AppIntroSlider

- Order food

- Order details after order

- etc.






I developed this app inspired by the tutorial project of "byProgrammer". Image and demo data is taken from there. But this project is structured in different way and also many other features such as google signin, search, Add to Favorite etc. have been added.
